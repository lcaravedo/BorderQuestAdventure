 PRD: Gameplay & UI Updates for "Chihuahua BorderQuest"
üìù Objective
Improve the UI cleanliness, enhance platforming mechanics, introduce collectable tracking, and update audio feedback for different major in-game events to improve player experience and polish.

üß© Requirements
1. UI Cleanup - Remove Redundant Scoreboards
Problem: Two extra scoreboards clutter the interface, overlapping the correct HUD.

Action:

Remove the two redundant/extra scoreboards from the UI.

Keep only the main HUD showing:

Lives

Health

Current Score

World & Level

Result: A cleaner, more minimalist retro HUD with no UI overlaps.

2. Platforming Mechanics - Enable Jumping onto Platforms
Problem: The player cannot jump onto higher platforms, limiting movement and gameplay.

Action:

Adjust jump mechanics so the Chihuahua character can reach platforms positioned above ground level.

If necessary, adjust jump height, gravity, and platform collision detection.

Result: The player should be able to jump naturally onto platforms for vertical progression.

3. Gameplay Tracking - Collectables System
Problem: No tracking yet for key collectables.

Action:

Create and track counters for:

Power-ups collected

Coins collected

Visa/Passport Stamps (hidden across levels)

UI Updates:

Add small, clean indicators in the HUD to show the number collected in each category.

Result: Players can track their progress in collecting items throughout the worlds.

4. Audio Feedback - Different Sound Effects
Problem: Same or unclear sound cues for saving, defeating enemies, and boss fights.

Action:

Assign distinct sounds for:

Saving the game (e.g., soft confirmation chime)

Defeating a normal enemy (e.g., small "bark zap" sound)

Defeating a boss (e.g., dramatic victory jingle)

Result: Players can audibly recognize different types of achievements.

5. Level Progression - End-of-Level Winning Sound & Lock Character Movement
Problem: No unique win sound at border crossings, and players can keep moving past goal.

Action:

Play a victorious "winning" sound when reaching the end-goal (e.g., Border Crossing).

Freeze or fade out character controls once the goal is reached, to transition cleanly to next level or story sequence.

Result: A satisfying sense of level completion without allowing uncontrolled post-goal movement.

"Hello AI! Please clean up the Chihuahua BorderQuest UI by removing extra scoreboards, enable platform jumping for the character, track collected coins, power-ups, and visa stamps, add separate sounds for saving, enemy kills, and boss victories, and make sure a winning sound plays at the Border with character movement locked after reaching the goal."
