Product Requirements Document (PRD)
🎮 Project Title
"Chihuahua BorderQuest: 8-Bit Freedom Adventure"

🎯 Objective
Develop a retro-style 8-bit adventure game where the player controls a Chihuahua protagonist on an epic migration journey from the Atacama Desert in Chile to Texas, USA. The game combines classic platforming mechanics, pixel-style animation, and sociopolitical satire, culminating in an unexpected twist: the chihuahua finds a job as a lab rat in an electric car facility.

🧩 Core Features & Gameplay Mechanics
🐶 Main Character
Protagonist: Chihuahua (name optional, customizable)

Special abilities:

Bark Attack (stuns enemies)

🖥️ User Interface
If implemented as a web-based retro game, the UI should use shadcn/ui for the menus, progress tracking, and in-game overlays (dialog boxes, maps, level select screen). The visual styling should match a retro 8-bit aesthetic, using shadcn's clean and flexible component structure to modernize the user flow.

Key components (suggested):

Card: character stat previews

Dialog: level complete screens

Progress: stamina, health, immigration status

Tabs: world selection

Tooltip: item and power-up descriptions

🔉 Audio/Visual Style
Visuals: 8-bit pixel art

Color palette: vibrant but region-themed (e.g., desert browns, jungle greens)

Audio: Chiptune soundtrack per region; barking SFX; boss fight music

Language: bilingual elements (English/Spanish) for signs and interactions

🧠 Narrative & Progression
Each level should subtly reference real cultural, geographical, and political themes. The tone is adventurous, occasionally satirical, but respectful. The narrative follows the Chihuahua’s pursuit of freedom, belonging, and work — ending in unexpected corporate servitude in an electric vehicle lab.
